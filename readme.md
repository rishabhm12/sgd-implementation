SGD-Implementation
============

This repository contains an ipython notebook where custom implementation of `stochastic gradient descent` is present. 

In this notebook, we compare the parameters and loss of sklearns `SGD classifier` and our custom model. We obesrve that  most of our model parameters have a difference of 10^-3 with sklearns model parameters on the same dataset.

The custom sgd implementation minimizes the logistic loss with L2 regularisation
